Develop a mini-Carsales application

Summary
We would like to evaluate your skills as a Full stack C# MVC developer. Your response to this simple task outlined below should provide a clear indication of your programming style.  We are looking for production quality code.
 
Task
Design a vehicle management system that for MVP will only cater for cars, but in the future will manage other vehicle types like boats, bikes, caravans etc.

On the home page, show a dropdown with “create car” The create dropdown will take you to a page where you can create new vehicles (car for now) which are saved to a data store. 

Vehicle Type	Properties	
Car	Id	
	vehicleType (car,boat,bike etc),	
	Make	
	Model	
	Engine	
	Doors (number of)	
	wheels (number of)	
	bodyType (hatchback, sedan etc)	
		
boat	…	

Be mindful that other vehicle types will be added in the future that have different properties. There will be common properties like Make and Model and there will be properties that are specific to a vehicle type. Think about ways in which you could cater for this. Please also think about the scenarios and validation that might be required.
